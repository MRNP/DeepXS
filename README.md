# DeepXS
Deep Learning applied to Quantum Field Theory. An AI that predicts LHC pair production cross-sections for supersymmetric particles at next-to-leading order. 

Requirements:
Recent versions of Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas and pyslha.

Instructions:

Run from command line with "python main.py -pairs N -return LO/NLO/both -stream 0/1/2 -Array 0/1 -fn filename"

The specifications for N as well as the required input structure for Arrays are given in the readme.txt.
